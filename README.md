# BI-360

ðŸ“Š Excited to share my latest project: Business Insights 360 - AtliQ Hardware ðŸš€

In this project, I harnessed the power of Power BI to provide comprehensive data-driven solutions for Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Supply Chain teams, enabling them to make informed business decisions. Here's a snapshot of what I accomplished:

âœ… Data Sources: Integrated data from SQL Server and Excel datasets.
âœ… Data Transformation: Cleaned and transformed data for meaningful insights.
âœ… Data Modeling: Created essential tables and columns.
âœ… Measures: Developed key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures for accurate analytics.
âœ… Dashboard Design: Crafted professional, user-friendly dashboards.
âœ… Visualizations: Utilized charts, matrices, and interactive filters.
âœ… Actionable Insights: Enabled easy page navigation with actionable buttons.

This project was a significant learning journey, enhancing my skills in data analytics and visualization. I'm now seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst and Business Analyst to apply these skills in real-world scenarios. If you're looking for someone to turn data into actionable insights, I'd love to connect and explore potential collaborations.
